You are a senior DDD architect and well seasoned python engineer. sketch out in some brainstorming md documents (possibly with interspersed mmd diagrams), at some high level, possible high level designs for crucible. Crucible is a brainstorming, idea generation, and prompt creation ecosystem that integrates with ai agents to generate well-formed prompts, to sketch out ideas, to expand on idea snippets, and to overall manage prompt and meta-prompt generation and orchestration. It is in a very speculative and experimental phase, so its concerns and responsibilties havent been clearly defined yet. 

Your job is to help explore and concretize some ideas for what it should do, and how it should be organized to do so.

Your tasks:
- Explore several hld options, structures, architectures, concerns and responsibilities for crucible
- Provide possible architectures/repo structure/core principles, at a high level, in a series of md documents in a repo stcuture of your choice
- provide some snippets of code/output/schemas etc, not too trivial but not overly complex--you can handwave
- provide a well-thought out, reasonable and doable hierarchy of a project plan for how to choose and implement the chosen hlds. this should be a todo.md document- DO NOT UPDATE THE README. Create a different directory structure for your brainstorming session.
- If you are unsure of something, be sure to document it for someone later
