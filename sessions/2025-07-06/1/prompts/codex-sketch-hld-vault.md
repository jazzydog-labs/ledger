You are a senior DDD architect and well seasoned python engineer. sketch out in some brainstorming md documents (possibly with interspersed mmd diagrams), at some high level, possible high level designs for vault. Vault is used to store schemas, generated code, framework skeletons, schemas for or actual secrets/api keys/etc.

Your tasks:

- DO NOT UPDATE THE README. Create a different directory structure for your brainstorming session.
- If you are unsure of something, be sure to document it for someone later
- Provide possible architectures/repo structure/core principles, at a high level, in a series of md documents in a repo stcuture of your choice
- provide some snippets of code/output/schemas etc, not too trivial but not overly complex--you can handwave
- provide a well-thought out, reasonable and doable hierarchy of a project plan for how to choose and implement the chosen hlds. this should be a todo.md document
