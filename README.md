ledger â€“ historical ledger of all generation sessions.

## Workflow

1. Each day gets a new directory in `sessions` (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).
2. Each distinct piece of work within a day gets a new sequentially numbered subdirectory (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`).
3. Each work directory contains `prompts`, `artifacts`, `metadata.yml`, and `summary.md`.
