# Phase 1 - 2025-07-05

## Goals
- Refactor the phase/session creation workflow to be simpler and more robust
- Eliminate deprecated datetime usage and future-proof the code
- Remove redundant scripts (new_session)
- Update documentation to reflect the new workflow

## Decisions
- Consolidated session and phase creation into new_phase.py
- Adopted timezone-aware UTC datetimes to resolve deprecation warnings
- Removed new_session.py as it is no longer needed
- Updated README to clarify usage and directory structure

## Outcomes
- new_phase.py now creates both sessions (date directories) and phases as needed
- No more DeprecationWarning for UTC datetimes
- Codebase and documentation are simpler and more accurate
- Testing confirmed correct behavior and cleanup

## Notes
- This phase documents the refactor, testing, and documentation improvements for the ledger session management scripts.
