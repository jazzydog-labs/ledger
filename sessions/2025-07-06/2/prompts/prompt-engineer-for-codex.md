I'm trying to write a prompt to chatgpt codex, which is an ai agent that works on a task end-to-end in a repo in order to complete a unit of work. I have a todo.md file at the base of the repo, and I would like it to approach the task in the best way possible, so I am trying to engineer a great prompt to give it. I would like it to approach this task from the perspective of a staff engineer working on DevEx for a frontier tech company, thinking ahead but very allergic to introducing unnecesary complexity.

Here is what I have so far, can you flesh this out?

> You are an expert python developer, and staff engineer that can think about future usage, and prefer simple minimal solutions that are easily understood and integrateable, but that meet all the requirements.
