# Phase 2 - 2025-07-06

## Goals
- Create a good prompt for codex to autonomously work

## Outcomes
- Had to change the prompt a little bit (don't want all tasks done, only one!)

## Notes
- It will make sense to extract parts of the prompt into different files..e.g. coding conventions which can be sourced from repo root metadata stuff/declarative files
- Not sure what makes sense to add to AGENTS.md vs provide as prompt...
